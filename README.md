# To-do List

This project was as part of a unit I completed at North Metropolitan TAFE, and involved researching and applying a modern web technology trend. I chose Meteor.js as a framework that I would investigate, learn how to use, and demonstrate it by creating an application.

Meteor is an open-source, isomorphic, full-stack JavaScript platform used to build modern web, desktop, and mobile applications. On the front end it can be used with any UI library such as React or Vue and the back end, Meteor uses Node with MongoDB being integrated as the default database.

During this project, I have practiced skills in identifying an emerging web technology, implementing a new web technology, and reviewing and finalising the implementation process. I have also developed skills in server-side programming using JavaScript, and the basics of using React as a UI library with TailwindCSS for styling.

This application includes an authentication system where users can register and login to their accounts, and a tasks component where users can create a list and check off tasks as they are completed.
